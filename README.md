# 🧠 Prediction-for-Anxiety-Levels-and-Depression-Levels

📌 Overview

This project implements a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in MATLAB for the assessment of depression levels. The system uses fuzzy logic rules to evaluate input factors and provide interpretable outputs, making it suitable for decision support in mental health studies.

🚀 Features

MATLAB Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for depression assessment.

Interactive GUI (.mlapp) built with App Designer for easy user interaction.

Handles linguistic inputs (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) with fuzzy membership functions.

Provides visual and numerical outputs for depression level classification.


🛠️ Requirements

MATLAB R2020a or later
Fuzzy Logic Toolbox
